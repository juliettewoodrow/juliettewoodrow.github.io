            <p>
I am a fourth-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by <a href="https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/index.html">Prof. Chris Piech.</a>
</p>
<p>
I am interested in how artificial intelligence can be used to improve teaching and learning at scale. I work on building tools that use recent advances in AI to support teaching and learning, including methods for providing feedback, probabilistic approaches to grading, and interpretable models of student understanding.
</p>

<p>I also love teaching and have been fortunate to teach computer science courses at Stanford and beyond! Lately, I have been thinking about how to introduce concepts of Large Language Models in ways that are accessible to students, and how these ideas can be used to deepen understanding of core computer science topics. </p>

{/* <p>Outside of research, I enjoy reading, hiking, listening to podcasts, and practicing or teaching pilates. If you have any book or podcast recommendations please send them my way! I try to read about 75 books each year and I am always looking for suggestions.</p> */}
