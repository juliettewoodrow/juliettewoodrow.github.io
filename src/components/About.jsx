I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford University advised by Prof. Chris Piech.

<p>
My research focuses on how we can leverage human-centered AI to improve access to education. Specifically, I focus on building tools that leverage the recent advacements in AI to enhance the teaching and learning experience. In addition to researching this area, I also greatly enjoy teaching and learning.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I enjoy reading, hiking, listening to podcasts, and practicing or teaching pilates. If you have any book or podcast recommendations please send them my way! I try to read about 50 books each year and I am always looking for suggestions :)</p>
